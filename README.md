## Project Description
Practice 10k is an all-in-one music application, designed by Dr. John Irrera and Dr. Annie Stevens, to help boost productivity and motivation during practice sessions. It enables users to organize their practice routines throughout the week, track progress towards specific goals, and engage in friendly competition. Named after the study that suggests 10,000 hours of practice is required to become an expert in a particular field, Practice 10k offers valuable features for anyone looking to enhance their practice sessions. These features include:
- a planning portal to schedule weekly practice plans.
- a practice portal that:
    - displays and manages the practice plans to complete for the day,
    - initiates those practice plans and provides any necessary tools such as a timer/tuner/metronome, while seamlessly logging in any data related to each plan (i.e., status and duration).
- a progress portal that displays the user's goals, trends, music distributions, earned badges, and peer comparisons.
- a journal that displays a comprehensive list of logged practice sessions by month.
- a profile page that displays and manages the user's personal information.

## Our Deliverables
We aim to deliver a fully functional mobile application compatible with both iOS and Android devices with the following core features:
- Authentication : ability to login or register and access the user's specific information.
- Home Screen : ability to view the user's overall performance and create/edit/delete practice plans (i.e., title, piece name, composer name, instrument and notes) for the week.
- Practice Screen : ability to view the user's incomplete practice plans for the day and initiate practice sessions that log any changes to the status and duration of each plan.
- Progress Screen : ability to view the user's daily/weekly/monthly/overall goals and composer distributions for the week.
- Journal Screen : ability to view practice plan details of those that have been started for any month.
- Profile Screen: ability to view/edit the user's personal information and logout/delete account.
